Overview of Project: 

LINEAR REGRESSION ON HOUSING PRICES:

Implement linear regression to predict housing prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. Use a dataset like the Boston Housing dataset for training and evaluation.

Dataset used: housing.csv

Objectives of Linear Regression:

Predictive Modeling: To predict the value of a dependent variable (target) based on one or more independent variables (features).
Trend Analysis: To identify and quantify relationships between variables, providing insight into trends and patterns.
Forecasting: To make future predictions based on historical data, useful in various fields such as finance, marketing, and economics.
Optimization: To optimize processes and systems by understanding the influence of different factors on a target variable.
Interpretability: To create a model that is easy to interpret, explaining how changes in input variables affect the output.

Key Elements of Linear Regression:
Dependent Variable (y): The variable you are trying to predict or explain.
Independent Variables (X): The variables that provide the input to predict the dependent variable.
Coefficients (β): Parameters that represent the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
Intercept (β0): The constant term in the regression equation, representing the value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero.
Error Term (ε): The difference between the observed and predicted values, accounting for variability not explained by the model.
Regression Line: A line that best fits the data points in the plot of the dependent variable against the independent variable(s).

Technologies Used for Linear Regression
Programming Languages:

Python: Widely used for its simplicity and powerful libraries.
R: Known for its statistical computing capabilities.

Libraries and Frameworks:

Scikit-learn (Python): Provides tools for data analysis and machine learning, including linear regression.
Statsmodels (Python): Offers extensive statistical models and tests.
Pandas (Python): Used for data manipulation and analysis.
Numpy (Python): Supports numerical operations on data.
Matplotlib/Seaborn (Python): Used for data visualization.
R Libraries: lm() function in base R, caret for model training and evaluation.
Development Environments:

Jupyter Notebooks: Interactive environment for coding and visualizing results.
IDEs: Such as PyCharm, RStudio, Google colab and Visual Studio Code for development and debugging.
